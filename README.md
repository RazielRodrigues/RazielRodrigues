<h3 align="center">The passion behind the codes:</h3>

<p align="center">
Passionate about technology since I was little, playing on the computer and playing video games has always been part of my life, my father was a programmer and I believe it is in my DNA to like codes, I was always curious to know how things worked inside the screens, encouraged by this curiosity and by my family, I decided to study database at FATEC Bauru.

<p align="center">
In the first semester of college I saw that that was what I wanted for my life, from then on I started to dedicate myself every day to learning web development and with time I came to the first opportunity, where it opened the doors to work with PHP and other technologies involving the Web.
</p>

<p align="center">
Today, I have a lot to thank the people who crossed my career and who taught me about professionalism, the world nowadays depends a lot on technology and I realize that we developers are the key point of all this, so I'm always improving myself and writing each line of code with a lot of responsibility, always looking to achieve excellence, because I know that this impacts a lot on the lives of those who use the software I program and the company I'm providing services to.
